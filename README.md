# **Number-Guessing-Game**

This Python script is a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a specific number.

**Usage :**

1. Run the script.
2. Enter your guess for the number when prompted.

The script will then check if your guess matches the correct number (which is 7 in this case) and display the result.

**Example :**

If you enter:
- Guessed number: 7

The script will output:
- Good Guess

If you enter a different number, it will output:
- You guessed [your guess], but the correct number is 7
